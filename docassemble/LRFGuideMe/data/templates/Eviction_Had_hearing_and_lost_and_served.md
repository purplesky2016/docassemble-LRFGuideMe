Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
====================================

You lost your eviction hearing at court
---------------------------------------

and 
----

You were served with a notice of scheduled eviction
---------------------------------------------------

This means that a judgment for possession (eviction) and, if you owed
rent, for damages has entered against you. It will also state that you
have to pay the landlord's court costs and interest that has come due on
any unpaid rent.

This also means that the landlord has gotten an execution from the
court, has now hired the county sheriff or a constable to forcibly
remove you from the apartment if you don't leave on your own.

Before a sheriff or constable can move you out, they **must** give you a
written notice of the date and time they will move you out. And they
must serve you with the notice at least 48 hours **before** the date on
the notice.

#### File a Motion to Stop Physical Eviction 

Even after you have been served with a notice of physical eviction, you
may be able to get the court to stop or postpone it. You need to ask the
court for \"Stay of Execution.\"

These \"stays\" are hard to get. Usually, judges only grant a stay if:

-   you have an emergency, or

-   you can show the judge that your landlord will not be harmed if the
    judge delays your eviction date.

#### Talk to your landlord

Even after you lose your eviction case, many landlords are still willing
to negotiate an agreement with you. If your eviction is because you owe
rent, some landlords will still make a payment plan and let you stay as
long as you can get caught up on your rent. Even if a landlord is not
interested in letting you stay long term, many landlords will agree to
give you a reasonable amount of time to move on your own because the
landlord has to pay more money to have you forcibly evicted.

#### Apply for shelter or Emergency Assistance

You may qualify for shelter if you have children and your landlord
evicted you because:

-   you could no longer afford your rent, or

-   you did not do something to cause your eviction.
